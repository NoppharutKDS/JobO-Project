JobO is a internship/cooperation finder mobile application where student can apply a job for internship and company can post their hiring for internship. The target of JobO is to help students to find the quality internship and help human resource to find potential student for hiring.

## Background

Many students who are currently studying Computer Engineering or Software Knowledge Engineering have a passion and potential to explore and discover new experiences in the software development field, although these students are fully ready, they struggle to find a software company that wants to have an intern. Also, we want to provide various positions in this field for the student to choose from among the well-known common positions like developers or data scientists. As mentioned, we want to create a mobile application to be a center between the company and the student to help a student find the right choice and great experience in this career path.
